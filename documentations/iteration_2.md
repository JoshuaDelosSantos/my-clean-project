# Actual iteration-2 board - Week 8-10: 

## Assumed Velocity:
- **It is important to note that the team is learning an entirely new framework for this project.**
- We will increase velocity from Iteration 1
- Velocity: **0.7**

## Number of developers:
**4**
## Total estimated amount of work:
**It's important to note that most team members are only able to work on this assignment for 5 hours a week! That essentially means +=1 working day per week.**
- 4(devs) X 4(working days) X 0.7(velocity) = 11.2 days
