## Have a shared understanding of the project.

### Target audience: 
- Individual cleaners & cleaning companies as the service providers.
- General public for the clients.

### How we plan to monetise:
- Start off as a free third party app that gathers all of the available cleaning services for the user (client).
- Once we get traction we plan to introduce a 'verification' system via subscription for service providers.
    - This 'verification' will push their services to the top of the lists (like Google search sponsorship).
- Furthermore, we also plan to allow one time ad services.

## Our 'budget':

We defined our budget as the amount of hours we are able to spend per week for this project.

- Josh:      10 hours
- Jack:      ~5 hours
- Callum:    ~5 hours
- Reece:      4 hours 

Adding it all up, our budget comes to **24 hours per week**.
There are 5 working days in 1 week: thats **~5 hours** per **day**.

## Software developement lifecycle framework:
Kanban was chosen because it aligns with our project’s flexible schedule, continuous development approach, and need for clear workflow tracking.

### Flexibility in managing tasks
- Since our team have limited time and members have responsibilities outside of university, a rigid method like **Scrum** wouldn't be ideal.
- Kanban allows tasks to be added, reprioritised, and adjusted continuosly without fixed sprints.

### Visualising workflow & progress
- A Kanban board provides a clear view of tasks, their statuses, and any bottlenecks.
- This helps everyone stay on track, even if they’re working at different times.
