# User story title: Service provider register
As a service provider I need to be able to register my service/s.

## Priority: 10

## Estimation: 2 days
- The service provider will register using an email andpassword.
- A verification email will be sent to confirm the registration.
- Basic profile details (e.g., business name, phone number, and location) will be required.
- Password must meet security standards (e.g., minimum 8characters, including a number and special character).
- Djangoâ€™s built-in authentication system will be used 

## Description:
The service provider should be able to register for an account by providing essential information. The system will validate inputs, create the account, and send a verification email. Upon successful verification, the service provider can log in and access their dashboard.

## Tasks
1. Create the User model with required fields.
2. Set up Django authentication.
3. Develop the registration form in Django view.
4. Implement input validation.
5. Create the registration API endpoint.
6. Implement email verification using Django's email backend. 
7. Design a basic frontend page for registration.
8. Write test cases for user registration.
