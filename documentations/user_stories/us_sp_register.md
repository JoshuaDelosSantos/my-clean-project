- Djangoâ€™s built-in authentication system will be used 

## Description:
The service provider should be able to register for an account by providing essential information.

## Tasks
1. Create the User model with required fields.
2. Set up Django authentication.
3. Develop the registration form in Django view.
4. Implement input validation.
5. Create the registration API endpoint. 
6. Design a basic frontend page for registration.
