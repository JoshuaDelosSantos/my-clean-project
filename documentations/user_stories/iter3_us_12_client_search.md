# Search function
As a user, I want to be able to search for services, bookings, or providers so that I can quickly find relevant information.

## Priority: 35

## Estimation: 3 days
~15 hours with our budget

## Assumptions:
- Users can search by keywords related to service providers, services, or bookings.

- The search functionality will support partial matches and filters (e.g., category, location, availability).

- The search results will be paginated for better performance.

- The system will use Djangoâ€™s ORM to handle search queries efficiently.

- The search bar will be available on the main navigation for quick access.
## Description:
The system should allow users to perform searches efficiently. The search function should return relevant results based on user queries, with filtering and sorting options.

## Tasks
1. Implement a search functionality in the backend using Django ORM.
2. Create an API endpoint for handling search requests.
3. Develop the front-end UI for the search bar and results page.
4. Implement filtering options (e.g., category, location, availability).
5. Optimize search queries for performance.
6. Document the search feature.
7. Conduct unit and integration testing.
