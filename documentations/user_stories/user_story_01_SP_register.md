# User story title: Service provider register
As a service provider I need to be able to register my service/s.

## Priority: 10
If the service provider cannot register/login, then we are not able to differentiate between client vs SP or differentiate between different SP.

## Estimation: 2 days
- Using Django built in authentication.
    - Then need to create a registration template.

## Assumptions:

## Description: e.g. The web page will show current deals to Orion's orbits users
- The web page will show a registration page.
- Service provider can then register.

## Tasks
1. Create service provider model.
2. Create a Django register form.
3. Create function for POST request. 

# UI Design:

# Completed:
* (New, not in the textbook) 
* Insert screenshots of completed. 
* If you have multiple versions (changes between iteractions), show them all.
