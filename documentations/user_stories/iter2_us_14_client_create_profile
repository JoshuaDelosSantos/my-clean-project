# Client Create Profile
As a client I should be able to create a profile where I can store my details.

## Priority: 45

## Assumptions:
- The client will create a profile using an email, username and password.
- Basic profile details (e.g., client name, email) will be required.
- Password must meet security standards (e.g., minimum 8characters, including a number and special character).
- Djangoâ€™s built-in authentication system will be used 

## Description:
The client should be able to create a profile on the site by providing a valid email address and a valid password.

## Tasks:

- Add validation constraints (e.g. unique email, valid password)
- Implement built in Django built-in authentication.
