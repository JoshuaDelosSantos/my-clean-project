# Service provider delete bookings
As a service provider, I should be able to delete bookings so that I can manage my schedule and remove canceled or incorrect bookings.

## Priority: 30

## Estimation: 2 days
~ 10 hours with our budget

## Assumptions:
- A service provider can delete only their own bookings.

- Deleted bookings will be permanently removed from the system (or optionally marked as "canceled" instead of full deletion).

- Clients will receive an email notification when a booking is deleted.

- The system will enforce authentication and authorization to prevent unauthorized deletions.

- Deleting a booking should not affect payment records if applicable.
## Description: 
Service providers need a way to remove unwanted or incorrect bookings from their schedule. The system should provide a secure method for deleting bookings while ensuring that affected clients are informed.

## Tasks
1. Implement delete functionality for the Booking model.
2. Create an API endpoint for deleting bookings.
3. Add confirmation prompts before deletion.
4. Ensure email notifications are sent when a booking is deleted.
5. Document the delete booking feature.
6. Conduct unit and integration testing.
7. Implement HTML and CSS for the delete action in the UI.

# UI Design:

# Completed:
* (New, not in the textbook) 
* Insert screenshots of completed. 
* If you have multiple versions (changes between iteractions), show them all.
