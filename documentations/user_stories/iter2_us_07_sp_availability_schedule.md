# Service provider schedule
As a service provider, I need to be able to view and list my availability on a schedule so clients know when I am free.

## Priority: 20

## Estimation: 5 days
~ 25 hours with our budget.

## Assumptions:

- The service provider will need to update their availability.

## Description:
The service provider should be able to view and update their availability on the schedule, which will be reflected on the listing for that service.
