# Service provider update bookings
As a service provider, I need to be able to update bookings so that I can manage my appointments efficiently.

## Priority: 30

## Estimation: 2 days

~10 hours with our budget

## Assumptions:
-A service provider can modify only their own bookings.

-Updates include changing the date, time, or status of a booking (e.g., confirmed, canceled, rescheduled).

-Clients will be notified via email when their booking is updated.

-The system will follow existing authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure only authorized users can make changes.

-Djangoâ€™s built-in forms and validation will be used for updating booking details.

## Description:
The system should allow service providers to update their bookings, ensuring that any changes are reflected in real-time.

## Tasks
1. Define update functionality for the Booking model.
2. Create an API endpoint for updating bookings.
3. Implement front-end UI for editing bookings.
4. Ensure that changes trigger email notifications.
5. Add documentation for the update booking feature.
6. Conduct unit and integration testing.
7. Implement HTML and CSS designs for the update form.


# UI Design:

# Completed:
* (New, not in the textbook) 
* Insert screenshots of completed. 
* If you have multiple versions (changes between iteractions), show them all.
